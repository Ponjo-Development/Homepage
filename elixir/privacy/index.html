    <p class="w3-opacity w3-animate-zoom">Last updated and effective: July 21, 2021.</p>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-animate-zoom">
      This privacy policy applies to the Discord bot application Elixir#1902 (@838118537276031006),
      referred to as "Elixir", the "Ponjo Team", "us", or "we".
    </p>

    <center><hr class="solid w3-animate-zoom"></center>

    <p class="w3-block w3-animate-zoom">
      Your privacy is important to us. Our policy is to respect your privacy regarding any information we
      may collect from you across our websites, services, and utilities. The Privacy Policies for each of
      our services, that of Elixir outlined below, provide a more detailed explanation of what data we store for each of
      our services, how long it is retained, how you can request for your data to be deleted, and more.
    </p>

    <center><hr class="solid"></center>

    <p class="w3-animate-zoom">
        By default, Elixir stores little data on its own. Upon execution of the <code>e!prefix</code> command,
        the bot's new prefix, as specified by the command executor, is added & saved into a secure database. The
        only data stored upon execution of this command is the guild ID, automatically generated by Discord, of the
        server the command was executed in, and the contents of the prefix itself, which are encrypted.
    </p>

    <p class="w3-block w3-animate-zoom">
      With respect to users, Elixir only stores user IDs in its database only if the user is a subscriber to Elixir's
      premium services. If this is the case, the user's unique user ID (automatically generated by Discord) is added
      to the database securely.
    </p>

    <p class="w3-block w3-animate-zoom">
      It is important to note that this data is only stored as it is required for the bot to properly function. The
      data is not stored with anyone else and remains confidential, and is all safely secured in a database on an
      OVHCloud dedicated server.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-center w3-padding-small w3-animate-zoom">ABOUT THE DATA WE STORE</h4>

    <p class="w3-opacity w3-animate-zoom">Where is data stored/processed?</p>

    <p class="w3-block w3-animate-zoom">
      All data stored by Elixir is exclusively secured within our United States servers. While some of our other
      services use servers across the globe, data stored by Elixir is restricted to the United States. All data is
      secured and regularly backed up for privacy and to provide the best experience for users of the bot.
    </p>

    <p class="w3-block w3-animate-zoom">
      In addition, all data stored by Elixir is securely encrypted for privacy reasons. Your privacy is very
      important to us.
    </p>

    <p class="w3-opacity w3-animate-zoom">More Regarding Data Retention and Deletion</p>

    <p class="w3-block w3-animate-zoom">
      If you would like to submit a data access request in order to see all information Elixir has stored with respect to

      specified above.
    </p>

    <p class="w3-block w3-animate-zoom">
      It is important for you, the user, to know that we only retain data for as long as deemed necessary for the
      purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Upon identity verification that it is indeed you, the user, who is
      requesting to have your data deleted, we will proceed with the process and all data we store with respect to
      you, the user, will be deleted promptly.
    </p>

    <p class="w3-opacity w3-animate-zoom">Disclosure of Your Data</p>
    <p class="w3-block w3-animate-zoom">
      There are very few circumstances in which we would disclose your information to other individuals or
      corporations. These circumstances are briefly outlined below.
    </p>
