    <p class="w3-opacity w3-animate-zoom">
      This privacy policy applies to the Discord bot application Elixir#1902 (@838118537276031006),
      referred to as "Elixir", the "Ponjo Team", "us", or "we".
    </p>
    <center><hr class="solid w3-animate-zoom"></center>
    <p class="w3-block w3-animate-zoom">
      Your privacy is important to us. Our policy is to respect your privacy regarding any information we
      may collect from you across our websites, services, and utilities. The Privacy Policies for each of
      our services, that of Elixir outlined below, provide a more detailed explanation of what data we store for each of
      our services, how long it is retained, how you can request for your data to be deleted, and more.
    </p>
    <center><hr class="solid"></center>
    <p class="w3-animate-zoom">
      By default, Elixir stores little data on its own. Elixir stores primarily guild IDs in order to manage
      the music queue of each guild individually. Each guild ID is encrypted. In addition, Elixir also stores history
      of some songs that have been played in a guild in order to best suit the autoplay feature for that guild.
      For example, if members of a particular guild have played lots of Queen songs, this data would be used to suggest
      more songs similar to Queen songs within the autoplay feature of the bot. Elixir no longer stores any data with respect
      to its users.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-block w3-animate-zoom">
      It is important to note that this data is only stored as it is required for the bot to properly function. The
      data is not stored with anyone else and remains confidential, and is all safely secured in a database on an
      OVHCloud server.
    </p>
    <h4 class="w3-center w3-padding-small w3-animate-zoom">ABOUT THE DATA WE STORE</h4>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-animate-zoom">Where is data stored/processed?</p>
    <p class="w3-block w3-animate-zoom">
      All data stored by Elixir is exclusively secured within our United States servers. While some of our other
      services use servers across the globe, data stored by Elixir is restricted to the United States. All data is
      secured and regularly backed up for privacy and to provide the best experience for users of the bot.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-block w3-animate-zoom">
      All data stored by Elixir is securely encrypted for privacy reasons. Your privacy is very important to us.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-animate-zoom">MORE REGARDING DATA RETENTION & DELETION</p>
    <p class="w3-block w3-animate-zoom">
      If you would like to submit a data access request in order to view all information Elixir has stored with respect to
      you, the user, you can do so by sending an email to Eerie, the bot's developer, at
      <a href="mailto:eerie@ponjo.club">eerie@ponjo.club</a> or by contacting an administrator in our Discord

    </p>
    <p class="w3-block w3-animate-zoom">

      specified above.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-block w3-animate-zoom">
      It is important for you, the user, to know that we only retain data for as long as deemed necessary for the
      purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Upon identity verification that it is indeed you, the user, who is
      requesting to have your data deleted, we will proceed with the process and all data we store with respect to
      you, will be deleted promptly.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-opacity w3-animate-zoom">DISCLOSURE OF YOUR DATA</p>
    <p class="w3-block w3-animate-zoom">
      There are very few circumstances in which we would disclose your information to other individuals or
      corporations. These circumstances are briefly outlined below.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-block w3-animate-zoom">1. If we (the Ponjo Development Team) are legally required to disclose the information.</p>
