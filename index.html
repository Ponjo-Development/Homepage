        <h2>
            <i class="fa fa-headphones ponjo-icon-link"></i> Elixir Music
        </h2>
        <p>
            Elixir is an advanced music bot for your Discord server with support for countless platforms. Enjoy your
            favorite tunes with fast load times, pristine audio quality, and more -- all without the hassle of having
            to download and install a bunch of software.
        </p>
        <p>
            We support popular music platforms like YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music. You can play music by inputting
            a search query or by using a direct link to a song. Elixir has 4 separate instances, so different people
            in your server can listen to different tracks. Unlike any other Discord music bot, Elixir has a powerful
            queue management system. View all tracks in the queue, and their hyperlinks. Skip to any track in the queue
            by its position, view data about any track, and more. Arguably Elixir's signature feature, Elixir has a
            playlist system that allows you to create and share playlists with your friends across Discord. All custom
            playlists are global and can be viewed and played by all people in Elixir's userbase. Customize your custom
            playlist to your liking -- add songs, remove songs, add playlists, set the playlist's name, set a
            description, a cover URL, and more. Configure your playlist to start with a custom volume, a custom loop
            setting, and extras. Elixir can fetch lyrics for any song you want. This feature is powered by Genius.
            You can even move your ongoing music queues from one guild to another!
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, Elixir music also has a fully-functional REST API that allows developers to interact directly
            with Elixir from their own applications. With easy-to-use endpoints and simple JSON responses, Elixir is a
            powerful tool for developers to customize our services to their likings.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Features</h3>

        </p>
        <h3>Pronoun API</h3>
        <p>
            The Pronoun API is an advanced LGBTQ+ resource and utility API that provides developers with all the
            resources they would ever need to fuse their applications with LGBTQ content, data, and assets.

            This API is embedded into the Ponjo API and provides the following features: a plethora of pride flags that
            can be easily accessed and used in your applications, a pronoun dictionary and data lookup in JSON format,
            an endpoint to add pride flairs to profile pictures, a full sexual orientation wiki in JSON format, and more.

        </h2>
        <p>
            Helios Practice was a public Minecraft practice PVP server for the Bedrock Edition variant of the game.
            The network reached a total of more than 9400 registered players and a peak of 32 concurrently online
            players. Due to a lack of developer motivation, time, and interest in the Minecraft Bedrock Edition
            community itself, as well as the notorious reason of financing, Helios Practice closed official on February
            1st, 2021, marking the end of the server's 8-month period, being officially released on June 14th, 2020.

    <section>
        <h2>A group of developers dedicated to the greater community.</h2>
        <p>
            We are a group of committed developers and hardworking organizers with the goal to develop customized
            programs and software for our clients. We are committed to our work, and we dedicate ourselves to create
            work that benefits the public. The Ponjo Development Team was initially founded as a side hobby, but it
            has become much more than that since then.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're dedicated to serving the community and providing numerous open-source projects for educational
            purposes: we want to inspire existing developers and help them learn more about the development workspace.
            Being a member of a development team is much more than simply coding. It's about collaborating with fellow
            developers, about planning & testing projects and applications, about analyzing existing work. No one
            person has all the necessary skills to complete a project: it's about working together.

            development from checking out our work, and I hope you become inspired to make your ideas a reality in the
